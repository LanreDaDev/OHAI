## If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application?

If given more time I would like to get to know the stakeholders(Product owner, users, customer, etc) of the application. I would want to know what the product owners wants the users to achieve with the application and the problems the users are looking to solve by using the App. I would also refactor the code and use a more consistent style guide in my CSS. I would also want to build a card component specifically for the Mobile view that makes use of the a gesture API for a stronger mobile experience.

## Would you implement anything differently?

The only thing I would change would be providing more data to manipulate. This would have made it easier to have a more robust UX.
